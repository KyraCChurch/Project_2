# My Project

For my project I made a spell book.
 

## What is it?

This spell book is an application where you can log into your own spell book and see only the spells you have added. Each spell can have a name, ingredients, and instructions. 

## Function

In this application you can signup as a new user and then login. Once logged in you can create spells. After creating a spell you have the option to edit or delete any spell from it's view screen which you reach after clicking it.

## My Success
SignUp <br>

## Not successful
Login, is not able to go from login screen to the beginning spell screen. <br>
Since I cannot reach the beginning spell screen I'm not sure what else was successful vs not.
